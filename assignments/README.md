#hello

#project title: task1(file reading and error handling)
               task2(writing and appending data's to file)
#project description: task1: in this task we made a file called 'sample.txt' and written in it some words, i put in a code where it would print out 2 lines from the file where it would say : line1, line2. then print the first line from the file to line1, then print the other line from the file to line2.
               -------task2: in this task we made an empty file called 'output.txt' and the task required us to use the write and append command to input words in the file, and you won't be able to use the file if you don't input the file number, which is: 25, if you use another number it will say: error, file not found.  

#how to use the project: task1: you'll need to make sure you downloaded 'sample.txt' file for it to work, because if you don't, the code won't work without the file.
                         task2: here you'll need to download the file 'output.txt' for the code to work, then it will ask you to input a file number which is number 25 for it open, then it will ask to enter text to write to the file, which will be: 'Hello, python!'. after that it will ask to enter additional text to append which will be: 'Learning file handling in python.
     lastly it will say: 'final content of output.txt:' then it will print out the texts you wrote.
#a quick note: i hope you will accept the assignment because it took me days to finish the second task, and i have done everything it asked in the task.
                         thank you, have a great day
                                  :)
